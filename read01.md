# What is Markdown?
**Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.**

### How Markdown differs from traditional formatting approaches?
- Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
- Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.
### How to use Markdown to format text?
**Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.**
1. For instance, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it
- # Heading One
2. to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it
- **this text is bold**

# Benefit Githup
