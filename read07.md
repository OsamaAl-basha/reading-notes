# Functions

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

 Defining functions
 Function declarations
 A function definition (also called a function declaration, or  function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

* The name of the function.
* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
* The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}

# Function scope
Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, because the variable is defined only in the scope of the function. However, a function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined.

In other words, a function defined in the global scope can access all variables defined in the global scope. A function defined inside another function can also access all variables defined in its parent function, and any other variables to which the parent function has access.
